We are a venture-backed, financial services startup based in Austin, TX. At Self, our mission is to help millions of people build credit and save money on their journey toward financial security. There are about 100 million people in the US who have low credit scores or who have no access to credit at all. Sadly, there aren’t many options for these people. Most banks aren’t doing anything material to change the situation because it’s not profitable for them to do so. Bad credit or no credit history can be barriers to renting an apartment or getting certain jobs, let alone buying a car or house. And if you can get a loan with a low credit score, you’re very likely to pay a lot more in interest over the life of that loan. Our team is passionate about challenging the status quo of the credit industry by giving people accessible and affordable tools to take control of their credit. Executing on our mission requires deep collaboration across our teams to ensure our products reach the people who can most benefit from them.

This assessment process results in cumbersome, clunky, and slow spreadsheets emailed back and forth, back and forth—eating up info security resources and ultimately delaying deals. That’s where Whistic comes in. Our game-changing 2-sided platform enables security and sales teams to proactively conduct and respond to third party security assessments by streamlining and automating the process, transforming the work for companies all over the world.

For instance, using React JS to build a responsive web portal, or hammering out an API in Express or Rocket. They are about taking ways of seeing the world that others have invented, and applying them to the task at hand. We value and respect this work, and our jobs involve a fair share of it, but we are looking for engineers who get up in the morning for the other 5%. We want the abstraction creators: the engineers who are more excited about the technology that doesn’t exist yet than the technology that does. We want people who are dreaming about creating new programming languages or operating system kernels, or even just small NPM packages with APIs that better reflect the problem space than prior abstractions. We need this because the business Bubble is in is taking common patterns for constructing software, and capturing those patterns in repeatable technology, so that they become accessible and intuitive via our visual language. We are in the business of figuring out how to let our users express what they want to create as simply and directly as possible, and then solving the hard problems of taking what they express and running it performantly, scalably, and securely in the cloud. In addition to creating better abstractions, the other pole of Bubble's business is helping our users solve their problems. Our users build everything from community projects to VC-backed startups. We are often a critical part of our customers’ operations. As a Bubble engineer, you get a direct feedback loop with customers: our community is incredibly vocal, and whenever we announce a release on our community forum, it always sparks feedback and engagement, and often celebration. So, the other thing we look for and value in our hiring process is people who love to ship code and see it impact people's lives. We live in a dynamic tension between passionate love for technology in its pure form, and pragmatic caring for the end product. That tension is our secret sauce: the constant back-and-forth between solving the customer problem, and designing the right long-term solution is what's led to a product that people tell us literally changed their lives (read our last fundraising announcement, and our community's reaction to it ). We have a number of hard problems we are trying to solve: Ensuring user-written queries get compiled into scalable, high-performant SQL Building tooling to help users secure their applications Evolving our core language from being an interpreter to more of a compiler to enable faster page loads Making Bubble easier to learn and more powerful by taking common user pain points and converting them into new language features We are looking for experienced programmers excited to help us tackle them. The ideal candidate loves solving hard technical problems to achieve a business goal, and has invested in their craft with a diversity of experiences. Familiarity With Our Stack Is Helpful, But Don’t Hesitate To Apply If You Haven’t Worked With All Of These Because we are hiring programmers to design and implement a new language, we don't have any hard requirements about what technologies you need to know coming in. AWS Postgres Redis Node Coffee-Script ES6 We Look For The Following In Candidates Goal orientation, and ability to find pragmatic solutions to hard problems Strong communication skills: we believe that the ability to explain your work to others is important Experience writing high-quality production code: ideally at least 1 - 2 years of professional experience, or multiple internships at startups or companies with strong tech cultures Diversity of technical background: we like candidates who have worked with multiple languages and problem spaces, because we think that breadth of experience makes it easier to see multiple potential solutions to a problem Alignment with our values: desire to empower others, a focus on team and user success over individual achievement, and transparency and willingness to admit mistakes and failures. We think Bubble is amazing, but we also think we have an incredibly long way to go. Our aim is huge: we are trying to replace the entire traditional engineering stack. As such, we think that we are going to continually build and rebuild our systems as we scale up: we have a limitless well of engineering challenges ahead of us to create the platform we envision. If you are passionate about creating technological leverage for people, and the idea of an early-but-growing startup whose main obstacle to success is our ability to solve hard engineering problems is exciting, we look forward to hearing from you!

You work with the Engineering team and cross-functionally to help solve customer needs and improve internal systems. You will help enhance and ensure the effective operation of our software as it relates to data and its interactions with our hardware applications. What you will do (responsibilities): Apkudo is agile, and so our days and duties can vary. In this role, some of the things you will do include the following: Use Python and a variety of other software tools such as PostgreSQL, Ansible, QEmu, AWS services (as well as others) to both solve problems and enhance data, hardware, and software issues. Examples may include designing or enhance ETL pipelines, refining pipeline connections with AWS RDS and/or helping enhance communications and data extraction with our hardware (shipping and receiving stations or our robotic testing machines). Respond and resolve operational and data issues, troubleshoot and initiate corrective actions as necessary, and use your experience to improve system stability using the right software tool for the job.  Please note that our general stack includes Python, PostgreSQL, AWS, React, JavaScript (ES6), and Node.js. Design new and improve existing internal data and other software features to enhance our offerings and products. Help our customers and internal teams better utilize our tools to make valuable strategic data-driven decisions. Work on multiple dissimilar projects at the same time: both intellectual and productive agility are required. What you will bring (experience and qualifications): At Apkudo, we enjoy delivering for each other and our customers, and we know there are many paths to performing well.  That having been said, we will expect you to come up to speed fast and deliver great work without too much guidance. We think it would be hard to do that in this job without the experience below: A degree in Computer Science or a related field with a Masters in Computer Science a plus. Please note that directly relevant experience may substitute for, and/or augment, relevant degrees. 5-9 years of progressive software experience working with hardware and software in a production environment. 3+ years of experience in Python design, implementation, and test including data-related work.  We are looking for someone to help us develop, refine, and enhance Python code used with Data AND in other areas. Experience working with software and hardware components for user-facing hardware and/or software applications. Experience with configuration management, virtualization, and Linux environments. Exposure to robotics and warehouse automation is a plus. Strong communication and problem-solving skills with attention to detail and the ability to work effectively both independently and with other remote team members. Excellent verbal, written, and organizational skills. If you think differently and know that you can do the job well, apply and show us! What we expect from everyone: What does it take to be successful at Apkudo? We expect ourselves and each other to: Put people first (by helping others be at their best--and making sure we are, too) Communicate clearly (by speaking candidly, regularly, and respectfully to everyone) Own our work and the outcomes (by taking personal ownership to deliver on the commitments we make to our colleagues and our customers) Trust and be trustworthy (by acting with integrity and providing excellent work for each other and our clients) Value everyone’s voice (because it’s all about the best ideas--not bureaucracy). What you can expect from us: Solving hard problems is challenging work, and we have designed Apkudo to support you in doing what no one else has done. Some of the ways we do that: 4 weeks of time off every year. Most of it doesn’t roll over because we know we won’t use it otherwise - and we know using it makes us better at our work and to each other. Flexible working hours and schedules (some positions - like this one - will do some on- call weekend work on occasion, but we expect you to take time off during the week to make up for it!) Casual dress and a casual environment with easy access to your peers, managers, and leaders A company-paid Google Pixel phone or a monthly credit to apply for your tech needs (including upgrading your bandwidth) 12 paid holidays, including Juneteenth and the day after Thanksgiving A monthly wellness stipend that you can use for things like a meditation app, standing desk, gym equipment, etc. 401(k) matching up to 4% Up to $5,250/year for certification, continuing education, and tuition reimbursements Insurance coverage we’re proud of for you, your family, and your spouse or domestic partner.  We pay 100% of the cost of coverage for you for vision (through VSP), dental (through Guardian Dental), and some medical plans (through United Health Care, the largest health insurance company in the U.S.). HSAs, FSAs (health care, dependent care), and commuter benefits to reduce what you have to pay for these parts of your life An open and communicative culture, innovation, and interesting problems to solve The fine print This role is remote though you may also be asked to travel on occasion.  Currently, our primary locations are Dallas, Baltimore, and Nashville.  Travel for this role is anticipated to be 0-5%. The physical requirements include prolonged periods sitting at a desk and working on a computer (though you can use the tech benefit to create whatever desk you’ll work best at). We are an agile organization, and so the duties and description of this role (like every other at Apkudo) may change at any time as we adapt. This position is exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). About Apkudo Apkudo is the developer of Hive, the platform for the management of the connected device supply chain. Through an applied combination of artificial intelligence, advanced analytics, and sophisticated automation, the Hive Platform manages the world of devices for all supply chain stakeholders by injecting intelligence and transparency throughout the entire device lifecycle: from design, development, testing, and certification to forward and reverse logistics. We test and certify, test and triage, and provide stakeholders (OEMs, Carries, Insurers, and 3PL) with the data to help them balance device quality, velocity, and precision across all supply chain processes to optimize device experiences and device value.

We do so by enabling people to transform data into something visual and understandable, helping them make important decisions based on those insights. If you are passionate about technology, but also care deeply about doing something meaningful, Tableau is the place for you. With large deployments of Tableau, containing millions of visualizations, we need to provide people with tools to find the data that is important to them. No matter how good our platform is at showing meaningful and beautiful visualizations, they can’t have an impact if they cannot be found. The search team’s mission is to create a unified content discovery and search experience for all of Tableau’s products. We do so by combining advanced search algorithms with machine learning to provide consistent and meaningful results appropriate to the users context and workflow to help them find relevant data and insights available within their organization to answer their business questions. As an engineer on the search team, you will develop and deploy UI components and services at scale building on top of Elasticsearch powering search across various Tableau products.

You should understand microservice design patterns well and how to create loosely coupled SaaS systems to find the right balance. You have experience with agile development methodologies and testing. You are interested in solving the search problem but prior experience in search is not a must. Relentlessly High Standards: Your personal software practices ensure you deliver high quality codes. You believe in automation and writing tests for your own code as a way of maintaining high quality in your products. Coding Rockstar: You understand what it takes to write software that is used by millions of people. You love writing things that \"just work\" - things that are reliable, scalable, and secure. You think far enough ahead to avoid tech debt, but know how to avoid over-engineering. You are agile and can prototype, learn, adapt, and pivot as needed.

Job Category Products and Technology Job Details What we do … In Tableau we help people understand data. We do so by enabling people to transform data into something visual and understandable, helping them make important decisions based on those insights. If you are passionate about technology, but also care deeply about doing something meaningful, Tableau is the place for you. With large deployments of Tableau, containing millions of visualizations, we need to provide people with tools to find the data that is important to them. No matter how good our platform is at showing meaningful and beautiful visualizations, they can’t have an impact if they cannot be found. The search team’s mission is to create a unified content discovery and search experience for all of Tableau’s products. We do so by combining advanced search algorithms with machine learning to provide consistent and meaningful results appropriate to the users context and workflow to help them find relevant data and insights available within their organization to answer their business questions. As an engineer on the search team, you will develop and deploy UI components and services at scale building on top of Elasticsearch powering search across various Tableau products. We follow a service oriented design, and use technologies such as React, JavaScript, Java, Python, Spring framework, docker, New Relic, Splunk, PagerDuty, Elasticsearch , Kubernetes, Octopus, and AWS. Currently we are looking for a full stack developer to join our fast growing search team. Some of the things you’ll be doing include … Participate in all phases of the software development life cycle. This includes defining and executing test plans for functionality, integration, regression, performance and UI. Participate in the evolution of the system architecture at scale to decouple our code bases into microservices and micro-frontends to enable incremental releases of search improvements. Contribute to the design, development, test and operational excellence of Java services and libraries supporting search functionality. This includes participating in on-call support for our services on a rotational basis. Build robust and scalable services leveraging cloud based infrastructure. Participate in design and code reviews, break down and estimate work, select and incorporate appropriate tools and frameworks for the job. Uphold a high standard of engineering excellence in source code, testing and operations. You will proactively anticipate risks and take steps to mitigate them. Who You Are … Experienced: You are well-versed in a variety of technologies and languages, and are in particular experienced in React and Java with at least 4+ years relevant experience. You have experience building scalable services in Java with common frameworks and libraries popular in Java shops. You’ve worked with a variety of database technologies with large datasets and understand how to optimize for maximum performance and scale. You should understand microservice design patterns well and how to create loosely coupled SaaS systems to find the right balance. You have experience with agile development methodologies and testing. You are interested in solving the search problem but prior experience in search is not a must. Relentlessly High Standards: Your personal software practices ensure you deliver high quality codes. You believe in automation and writing tests for your own code as a way of maintaining high quality in your products. Coding Rockstar: You understand what it takes to write software that is used by millions of people. You love writing things that \"just work\" - things that are reliable, scalable, and secure. You think far enough ahead to avoid tech debt, but know how to avoid over-engineering. You are agile and can prototype, learn, adapt, and pivot as needed. DevOps Mindset: You are familiar with DevOps practices. You treat operational issues as they are software problems. As you write your code you are already thinking about how to operate them efficiently in production. Team Player: You enjoy collaborating with, learning from, and teaching others (including across disciplines) so we all become better. You enjoy fostering a continuous learning environment and champion technical excellence within the team. You are a Recruiter! Tableau hires company builders and, in this role, you will be asked to be on the constant lookout for the best talent to bring onboard to help us continue to build one of the best companies in the world!

Job Category Products and Technology Job Details What we do … In Tableau we help people understand data. We do so by enabling people to transform data into something visual and understandable, helping them make important decisions based on those insights. If you are passionate about technology, but also care deeply about doing something meaningful, Tableau is the place for you. With large deployments of Tableau, containing millions of visualizations, we need to provide people with tools to find the data that is important to them. No matter how good our platform is at showing meaningful and beautiful visualizations, they can’t have an impact if they cannot be found. The search team’s mission is to create a unified content discovery and search experience for all of Tableau’s products. We do so by combining advanced search algorithms with machine learning to provide consistent and meaningful results appropriate to the users context and workflow to help them find relevant data and insights available within their organization to answer their business questions. As an engineer on the search team, you will develop and deploy UI components and services at scale building on top of Elasticsearch powering search across various Tableau products. We follow a service oriented design, and use technologies such as React, JavaScript, Java, Python, Spring framework, docker, New Relic, Splunk, PagerDuty, Elasticsearch , Kubernetes, Octopus, and AWS. Currently we are looking for a full stack developer to join our fast growing search team. Some of the things you’ll be doing include … Participate in all phases of the software development life cycle. This includes defining and executing test plans for functionality, integration, regression, performance and UI. Participate in the evolution of the system architecture at scale to decouple our code bases into microservices and micro-frontends to enable incremental releases of search improvements. Contribute to the design, development, test and operational excellence of Java services and libraries supporting search functionality. This includes participating in on-call support for our services on a rotational basis. Build robust and scalable services leveraging cloud based infrastructure. Participate in design and code reviews, break down and estimate work, select and incorporate appropriate tools and frameworks for the job. Uphold a high standard of engineering excellence in source code, testing and operations. You will proactively anticipate risks and take steps to mitigate them. Who You Are … Experienced: You are well-versed in a variety of technologies and languages, and are in particular experienced in React and Java with at least 4+ years relevant experience. You have experience building scalable services in Java with common frameworks and libraries popular in Java shops. You’ve worked with a variety of database technologies with large datasets and understand how to optimize for maximum performance and scale. You should understand microservice design patterns well and how to create loosely coupled SaaS systems to find the right balance. You have experience with agile development methodologies and testing. You are interested in solving the search problem but prior experience in search is not a must. Relentlessly High Standards: Your personal software practices ensure you deliver high quality codes. You believe in automation and writing tests for your own code as a way of maintaining high quality in your products. Coding Rockstar: You understand what it takes to write software that is used by millions of people. You love writing things that \"just work\" - things that are reliable, scalable, and secure. You think far enough ahead to avoid tech debt, but know how to avoid over-engineering. You are agile and can prototype, learn, adapt, and pivot as needed. DevOps Mindset: You are familiar with DevOps practices. You treat operational issues as they are software problems. As you write your code you are already thinking about how to operate them efficiently in production. Team Player: You enjoy collaborating with, learning from, and teaching others (including across disciplines) so we all become better. You enjoy fostering a continuous learning environment and champion technical excellence within the team. You are a Recruiter! Tableau hires company builders and, in this role, you will be asked to be on the constant lookout for the best talent to bring onboard to help us continue to build one of the best companies in the world!

Unlike traditional aerospace companies, we sell information, not hardware - we operate our sensors cost-effectively at continental scale to produce novel data streams about pressing global problems. First on our list: spotting hard-to-monitor emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that accelerates climate change. Since starting continuous survey operations in 2018, Kairos has removed methane emissions equal to over 9.2 million tonnes of CO2e through our work. To put that in perspective, that’s equivalent to over 2 million cars being removed from the roads for a year or shutting down about seventeen 350 MW coal-fired power plants. We call that a good start. As a team, we love science and engineering, we love getting our hands dirty with hardware and software, and we love seeing our work make a difference in the real world. We’ve created a diverse, collaborative, supportive, and fun environment based on integrity and treating people right. So no matter your gender, gender identity, race, age, beliefs, sexual orientation, or disabilities, we welcome you and would like to work with you. :-) It’s never boring, it’s always challenging, and we’re usually laughing. \\ufeffSoftware Engineer, Hardware Systems Kairos hardware ranges from Linux single board computers to short wave infrared imaging cameras to GPS/INS systems and are used to collect the various imagery that goes into our final data product. Directly related to the hardware, Kairos actively maintains the following software projects which enable that operation: * Python based platform for ingesting real time flight telemetry, displaying data to a front end, and acting as an endpoint for a user to communicate with the imaging devices. * Flight software (C++) that leverages camera SDKs to collect and store data. * Repository of custom Debian packages used to configure a Kairos single board computer. * Python based project that leverages pyvisa to control lab testing equipment (power supply, electronic load, oscilloscope) to run a suite of automated tests on our hardware. A software engineer operating in this role will contribute and maintain some or all of these projects. Kairos is currently hitting a scale point and much of our hardware-facing software needs to be improved in order to enable safe, smooth and scalable operations to meet that demand. You will work directly at the interface between the hardware, operations, and software teams to listen to field feedback, take in suggestions, and implement the solution. You will also work directly with the hardware itself at our office in Mountain View enabling you to reproduce field issues, troubleshoot them, and push fixes out into the field. Required 3+ years of experience The ability to learn quickly in a self-guided manner - much of what we do is solving new problems by integrating one or more pieces of new technology. Experience working with hardware systems at either an embedded level or a level higher up in the stack (telemetry systems, hardware-in-the-loop testing, hardware simulation, etc) An ability to work in conjunction with hardware engineers and operations engineers to take input and suggestions and turn those into scalable software solutions. A desire to solve real-world problems over working on technical problems in isolation - none of our work fits in neat boxes. Instead, we have a team that is focused on the impact our work can have on the future of life on the planet and prioritizes real-world progress over problem-focus purity. Desired Significant Python experience. C/C++ experience. Familiarity with Bash / shell scripting Interest in developing testing systems around physical hardware Experience working with embedded Linux systems System administration experience - building Docker images and defining and configuring customized Linux distributions Experience integrating with camera capture SDKs for network and USB connected cameras. Experience using React to build web UIs. Life at Kairos A few important facts about working at Kairos Aerospace: - We provide health, dental, and vision insurance, including subsidized coverage for dependents. Our 401K plan does matching based on the amount of methane we removed from the atmosphere in a given year. - We think death-march hours are a bad way to run a company. We expect something approximating a 40-hour workweek, but mostly we just care that your work gets done. No, really. (Full disclosure: we occasionally put in some extra hours during crunch periods, but that is the exception, not the norm). - We do not track vacation time, nor do we have set hours to be in the office. Instead, we encourage taking real vacations, mental health days, leaving early to pick up the kids, working from home, time-shifting commutes, staying home when you're sick, ducking out to the gym - we believe work time should be flexible. In this time of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have transitioned to 100% remote work aside from hardware and flight operations and plan to continue having remote positions in perpetuity. (We love it when kids make a cameo in a video call.) \",\n",
